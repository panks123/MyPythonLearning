# OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
# It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
# When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library
# for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i.e whatever operations
# one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.
