# Python Practice problem 1 (Easy, 10 points)
# Your Age In 2090
# Take age or year or birth as an input from the user and tell them when they will turn 100 years old.(5 points)
# Donâ€™t use any type of module like datetime or dateutils(-5 points).
#
# They can then optionally provide a year and your program must tell their age in that particular year. (3 points)
# You should be handling all sorts of errors like (2 points):
# You are not yet born
# You seem to be the oldest person alive
# You can also handle any other error if possible!
