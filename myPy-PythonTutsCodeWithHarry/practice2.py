# Practice Problem 2 (Easy) | Python Tutorials For Absolute Beginners In Hindi #105
# Problem Statement:
# Harry potter has got n number of apples. Harry has some students among whom, he wants to distribute the apples.
# These n number of apples are provided to harry by his friends and he can request for few more or few less apples.
#
# You need to print whether a number in range mn to mx is a divisor of n or not.
#
# Input:
# Take input n, mn and mx from the user
#
# Output:
# Print whether the numbers between mn and mx are divisor of n or not. If mn = mx, show that this is not a range
# and mn is equal to mx. Show the result for that number
#
# Example:
# If n is 20 and mn=2 and mx = 5
#
# 2 is a divisor of 20
#
# 3 is not a divisor of 20
#
# â€¦
#
# 5 is a divisor of 20

try:
    n=int(input("Enter no. of apples harry has got"))
    mn=int(input("Enter minimum no. of students"))
    mx=int(input("Enter maximum no. of students"))

except Exception as e:
    print("Wrong Input| Above inputs should have been numbers")
    exit()

for i in range(mn,mx+1):
    if(n%i==0):
        print(f"{i} is a divisor of {n}")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is not a divisor of {n}")
